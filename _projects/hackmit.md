Having custom music based on mood is amazing! But we don't want to sit around and type prompts every single time, so that's why we decided to use wearable information to automatically generate music.BeatBrew is connected to your wearable (Apple Watch, Garmin, Fitbit, etc) and uses TerraAPI to stream your health data live to our app, allowing us to predict your mood! Based on how you're feeling at a given moment, we'll create some special songs for you!
