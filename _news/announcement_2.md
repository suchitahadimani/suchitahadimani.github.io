Hackathons you'll see me at!

---

With this being my last year of college, I have a huge bucketlist of college hackathons I want to go to! After graduating, I won't be able to go as a participant anymore after this year, so I'm hoping to have a lot of fun this year!

#### Hackathon List

<ul>
    <li>HackMIT</li>
    <li>HackHarvard</li>
    <li>ShellHacks</li>
    <li>PennApps</li>
    <li>More coming soon!</li>
</ul>
