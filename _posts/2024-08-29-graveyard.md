Why a graveyard in the projects sections?

It’s for all the projects that I started on, but lost interest mid-way through.

The analogy with this is with writing.

I like writing. I’m not very good at it, but I’ve been writing for some time now. Some pieces are good. Some are not. Most are unfinished. 

My rule of thumb is to keep working on a story until it’s complete or until it loses life. If no matter how much I try, I can’t think of how a story can progress, or how I can fill in what feels missing, or how I can carry the magic of the story all the way through, then I stop. And move on to the next piece.

The same applies to software engineering projects. I will keep working on a project as long as it has life. I didn’t want to keep deleting the unfinished projects, regardless of how much or how little progress I made, hence a graveyard.
