Hello! I'm Suchita, and I'm a computer science student at George Mason University. I'm currently working on my master's degree and am set to graduate May 2025! So excited! I recently graduated with a B.S (2024) in Computer Science also from GMU.

I've had a long adventure with CS (as most students) filled with love and hate, despise and appreciation, frustration and pride. I've done a few things here and there. I've taken a few classes here and there. I've had a few opinions here and there. Feel free to check it all out!

I do have a bit personality outside of CS. I try to post pictures on my [photography](http://instagram.com/chetuclicks) instagram. I tried to be a youtube [star](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhF6JEnhzCI). I tried to be a short story [writer](https://caribbeancocktails.wordpress.com/). I play the ukelele and I like to draw (evidence coming soon). Most of all, I like trying new things, so keep checking back for the latest updates :D
