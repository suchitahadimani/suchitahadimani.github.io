Here are my opinions of the courses I have taken while I was at George Mason. Might be helpful, might be random. Feel free to take a look


Fall 2024
About to start!

SWE 660: Real-Time Embedded Systems
SWE 632: UI/UX Design
CS 655: Wireless and Mobile Computing


Summer 2024
Went back to India again, this time for 2 months. I traveled and toured a lot more than other summers and also got to experience a bit of normal life in India too. It completely changed me. It felt like I had finally got the reset I was looking for. After coming back from India, I prioritized myself. I started to exercise, eat healthy well-balanced meals, and sleep for 8 hours. I also took two online classes, which I hated during the trip, but am very glad I took because it reduced my tuition quite a bit. 

CS 550: Database Systems
Grade: A
Difficulty: 2/5
Enjoyment: 2/5 
Advice: Think carefully about whether you can actually take a class while traveling, because despite getting an A, I was very close to mentally giving up and failing. Also, make sure to set up software stuff for actually doing databases, because it does take a considerable amount of time. The videos posted on blackboard are actually helpful, and did give some hints for the homeworks and projects, so check those out too!

I was traveling while taking this class, so I ended up doing everything last minute. There were only 3 submission deadlines for this class, so it was a little hard to resist the temptation to procrastinate. I had a lot of trouble setting up oracle and that led to me submitting ⅓ homeworks late and the project late as well. Somehow, the professor curved and allowed my late submissions and I passed with an A.

SWE 642: Software Engineering for WWW
Grade: A-
Difficulty: 1/5
Enjoyment: 2/5 
Advice: Memorize the quizzes for the exams, if you’re trying to take the easy way out. If not, just do a project for each of the modules, and the questions asked on the quiz won’t feel as random anymore, but still glance through the quiz questions just in case.

The professor was very nice. I talked to him for an hour while trying to show my extra credit work. He gave out late extensions if enough people asked for one. The homeworks were graded very lightly. This class felt like a crash course into software engineering, covering topics like kafka, docker, kubernetes, angular, node, and AWS. Helpful course in terms of just understanding on a very beginner level what all these technologies are, you will probably need to build a project or do something on your own to actually retain the content for this course.



Spring 2024
This semester, I was tired. It felt like I had burnt out from being stressed (not sure if that’s a thing but that’s what it felt like). I just did my classes and kept moving towards my graduation. No matter what happened, I just wanted to complete a major milestone. I received my bachelor’s degree. 

CS 475: Concurrent and Distributed Systems
Grade: C
Difficulty: 5/5
Enjoyment: 2/5 

CS 455: Computer Communications and Networking 
Grade: B
Difficulty: 2/5
Enjoyment: 5/5 
Advice: If you have Parth Pathak, go to class! The lectures are more than enough for learning the content. If you’re going into SWE or cyber, this class will be very important for you to understand, so pay close attention. Be patient with the projects as they do take time, and ask the professor for help!

Good teachers make good classes. I had this class with Parth Pathak and genuinely enjoyed learning about networking. I’ve never considered myself as someone who would be interested in networking after a poor experience trying to do Cisco networking during cyber patriot competitions in 8th grade, but this class was truly amazing. It also covers some very crucial concepts which every CS major should know. The projects in this class are difficult but graded lightly (I self calculated a grade of 60 based on his rubric but received an 80). I don’t say this often, but I do wish he graded more harshly, because the projects did truly cover a variety of concepts we covered in class and brought forth a deeper understanding of the material.


CS 571: Operating Systems
Grade: A-
Difficulty: 3/5
Enjoyment: 3/5 
Advice: Start the projects early, sometimes the setup itself takes time. Running and testing it are a hassle as well.  Don’t stress too much!! It seems scary but it’s not too bad!! Also make sure you watch the project description videos, sometimes they give hints on how to get started (I missed out on this).


A very fun class, though it did feel redundant at times with a lot of overlapping concepts from systems programming. I did well on the threads and traffic synchronization projects due to the distributed systems class, but many people tend to struggle with this. They tend to grade very lightly for this class, but it would be best to study and prepare. 

CS 580: Intro into Artificial Intelligence
Grade: A-
Difficulty: 3/5
Enjoyment: 4/5 
Advice: You can self-learn by watching the videos put out by UC Berkeley and also doing their homework problems to help you solidify the concepts, instead of the professor’s lectures. So I guess, all my compliments below are referring to UC Berkeley as opposed to this class.

This class did a good job of introducing us to a lot of very basic but fundamental concepts which make up AI. The entire curriculum was based very strongly around UC Berkley’s AI class, but the class is good nonetheless. The projects were also very good at teaching us the basic concepts, and implementing what we learned, though the “bonus/challenge” questions were quite difficult. We covered statistics, reinforcement learning, game-based problems (minimax, expectimax), search algorithms and constraint satisfaction problems.The best way to do well on the midterm/final is by doing all the problems given in class and doing different variations of that. Taking this class allowed me to gain a better appreciation for AI. I do admit though, out of our class of 70, only 10 people attended regularly. You are better off learning from the original UC Berkeley content, it is very good. 

CS 583: Algorithms
Grade: A
Difficulty: 3/5
Enjoyment: 2/5 
Advice: Work on proofs and do similar problems to practice the concepts learned in class. Start leetcoding now! If you didn’t start before, now is a good time to start. 

Before I started I thought this class would be like leetcode or coding interview prep, however it was far more focused on proofs and defining the algorithms that we were working with. Doing the proofs was a bit difficult and we weren’t given too much guidance in how to set them up, but the exams were very similar to the homeworks so that helped. There was a good amount of focus on search/sort algorithms and graph algorithms more than any other topic.




Fall 2023
I was staying at home this semester. I learned to balance managing housework and cooking on top of school work, which proved to be a new set of challenges. I took 19 credits this semester (6 classes) but there were more CS classes this time. This semester I was infected with a strong case of imposter syndrome and job anxiety.

CS 321: Software Engineering
Grade: B
Difficulty: 3/5
Enjoyment: 3/5 
Advice: Check rate my professor for this class especially :) Be prepared for a lot of writing.
This class had the potential to be fun/relevant/engaging. However, the professor I had it with made us do everything in Java, use class structures that he defined, and also build a product that he decided. It ended up feeling very restricted and I found it difficult to enjoy class. The quizzes and tests were irritating, and I often relied on rote memorization to do the quizzes. There was a lot of documentation that we needed to do for SWE, activity/sequence diagrams, project updates, and sprints, which did a decent job at teaching core SWE concepts, but I do wish we had more creative liberty in our project.

CS 367: Computer Systems and Programming
Grade: A
Difficulty: 2/5
Enjoyment: 2/5 
Advice: Actually attend lectures and labs, I promise you will not have to study outside of class that much at all. Lots of very good repeated learning built-in to the course structure (lecture, lab, quiz, and final review questions). Use it!!


Good teachers make good classes. I had this class with Andrea and I genuinely loved learning about low level concepts – something I never thought was in me. I had a fixed mindset before this class that I would never be able to enjoy anything even remotely related to the 1’s and 0’s that made up the computer and anyone who did must have been a masochist. But this class was very well taught and projects were well designed. This class acted as a pivoting point for me. I was starting to truly understand and appreciate CS starting with this class.


CS 478: Natural Language Processing
Grade: A-
Difficulty: 2/5
Enjoyment: 3/5

Fun class with some interesting projects. It actually taught a lot of really cool stuff and the professor was super sweet. I thought it was going to be very hard, but the pacing of the coursework was nice and there was a gradual buildup in difficulty. 

CS 484: Data Mining
Grade: A-
Difficulty: 4/5
Enjoyment: 2/5 
Advice: Don’t get scared by the math. I promise it’s all learnable, just be patient. You will also have to google a lot for this class because you will need to use builtin python functions which are optimized otherwise your models will just be too slow. I would recommend starting off by building the models on your own to get a good understanding of how the algorithm works in general, and then google optimizations (e.g. matrix multiplication instead of for-loops) so you understand why it’s making it faster. 

This first lecture I attended, I feel like the professor just tossed some really fancy eigenvalues and math equations at us to scare us away. It ended up being not bad and I learned about some basic machine learning models such as linear regressions, logistic regressions, k-means clustering, k-nearest neighbors, and neural networks.

CS 485: Autonomous Robotics 
Grade: B+
Difficulty: 4/5
Enjoyment: 5/5 
Advice: If you’re interested in robotics, highly recommend this class! The professor is very open to advising and helping. One of the groups got funding to do their project too, I think? Very good opportunity.

Loved this class. It was kinda hard in terms of actual concepts. We discussed motion planning and motion control which are important topics in robotics, however, we were never actually given problems to practice those concepts so it made the exams very difficult. The project, though, was incredibly fun and I loved working with the group to work on the F1TENTH project. Learned how to cad and use gazebo simulations. I learned how to set up Linux using WSL, VM, and dual boot. My group was great too and I actually made friends in the class. This robotics class is one of my favorite conversation topics, so I guess if you need more things to talk about, this class might be it for you.

HNRS 360: Ethics in Nuclear Energy
Grade: A
Difficulty: 0/5
Enjoyment: 0/5 

Boring class. Required attendance. Had to do a paper/presentation. Did not like it.



Summer 2023
I did BreakThroughTech’s AI summer program which I really enjoyed. Went to India after 5 years. Learned how to cook. I wish I had done more leetcode this summer.

Spring 2023
By now, everything had sort of settled down. I had registered for 21 credits (7 classes) this semester in order to graduate early. My bad habits had caught up to me. I had completely stopped going to the gym, started eating junk food at the dining halls, and had no motivation to do very much. I had a little bit of energy at the beginning of the semester during which I recorded and posted my first youtube video, but that was pretty much it. I dropped out from 2 research projects and just did classes.

CS 262 : Low Level Programming
Grade: A
Difficulty: 2/5
Enjoyment: 4/5 
Advice: If you have this class with Hamza or Andrea (not sure who else is teaching now), actually attend classes because I promise you won’t have to self-study outside of class if you just pay attention to their lectures. They both clearly explain all the important concepts and then ask exactly those concepts in the exams. This is the beginning of the C-language chain classes at GMU, so make sure you get comfortable programming in C! The entire low-level chain (CS 262, CS 367, CS 471)  at GMU is well defined and concisely planned. Each class builds upon the foundation of the previous and I highly recommend taking the classes consequently, with no break semesters in between classes.

Really enjoyed this class on C. I had it with Hamza, who was very chill. The labs were on the concepts we learned during the week, which made it really good for reinforcing learning. I’m a huge fan of small but weekly assignments as it helps with pacing of the course as opposed to big projects. CS 262 did it well. Everything was very very fair.

CS 310: Data Structures
Grade: A-
Difficulty: 2/5
Enjoyment: 2/5 
Advice: While you go through this class, try to implement the data structures. You’ll have to do it anyway for the projects, but for the data structures the project does not cover, take the extra step and do it anyway. Implementing data structures gives you a very solid understanding of key concepts, and it lasts longer in your memory. Now would be a good time to start doing some easy leetcode problems!

I don’t remember much of this class, and stopped attending it despite the attendance points. I already knew data structures before this class and the projects were easy for me. I was panicking about the final as my knowledge in trees and graphs was a bit lacking, but it ended up being not too heavily tested. 

CS 330: Formal Methods and Models
Grade: A
Difficulty: 2/5
Enjoyment: 3/5 
Advice:  If you ever want to learn compilers (CS 440), the stuff on finite automatas comes back. It also comes back a bit for AI, networking, and algos. The topics on proofs become very relevant in algorithms (CS 483), which is a proof heavy class.


I took this class with Ivan and he was a great professor. Lectures well and was responsive to emails and questions. I found myself getting lost a lot in this class, but I would say it was definitely worth putting the time and effort into understanding it because the final ended up being a breeze and I got more than 100.  Learned about proofs, predicate logic, automatas, and grammars. Loved the weekly quizzes, it helped a lot with distributing load throughout the semester.


HNRS 130: Memory, Art, and Identity
Grade: A+
Difficulty: 0/5
Enjoyment: 2/5 

Not really too memorable, a little bit of forced participation as it was all full class discussions. We had to watch a movie as an assignment and present a piece of art as our final project.

HNRS 260: What is Democracy?
Grade: A
Difficulty: 0/5
Enjoyment: 4/5 
Advice: Actually read the books and discuss your opinions!! Discussions were so much more fun when everyone read the content and presented their opinions (even if the opinions were silly)

I like discussion-based honors classes, so I definitely liked this one too. We ended up reading 4 books which I found to be very interesting in shaping the definition of a democracy. I regret not writing a piece on what I learned in that class, because I unfortunately forgot a good portion of it. But I have fond memories of this class in terms of reading, discussing, and sharing.

OR 442: Stochastic Operations Research
Grade: A+
Difficulty: 1/5
Enjoyment: 2/5 

Very easy class. It’s taken by senior students mostly, so the teacher was very generous in terms of grading. Many recap topics taken from STAT 344, plus some additional topics like monte carlo simulations, markov chains, and inventory models.

Fall 2022

This was my first semester in college and I think it was the most fun semester I’ve had so far at the time of writing. I stayed on campus this year after convincing my parents that it would be worth it despite living nearby. It was a good decision and I definitely liked it in terms of my social life and my sense of independence. I started going to the gym. I ate healthy foods in the dining hall (salads, sandwiches, milk, and no dessert). I made a lot of new friends and had a huge friend group. This was also the first semester I began to slack off, procrastinate, and skip classes, a huge deviation from the way I was during high school. The temptations of constantly being with friends and the small ego boosts I got from doing assignments last minute and still performing better than the class average set up some bad habits which would end up hurting in the future. But ignorance is bliss and the fall semester passed by wonderfully with lots of  school events, random trips, and midnight drives. 

My first semester was fairly easy and consisted primarily of intro-level classes. 

CS 110 : Essentials of Computer Science
Grade: A
Difficulty: 1/5
Enjoyment: 2/5 
Advice: It was a chill class, just do the little assignments and go through the notes for the exams. Very easy class, but definitely know people that didn’t pass because they slacked off a bit for submitting things on time or not brushing up before the final.

A rather boring class which I attended somewhat intermittently to get the minimum participation. Looking back, the content of the class was interesting and did sort of give a brief introduction into some major topics like hexadecimal and encryptions. It was hard to see the relevancy of these topics then, so I ended up brushing it. Quizzes, tests, assignments. Everything was easy. I had a lot of friends in this class, so I enjoyed goofing off.

CS 211 : Object-Oriented programming
Grade: A
Difficulty: 1/5
Enjoyment: 1/5 
Advice: Make sure you understand the basic OOPs principles (polymorphism, inheritance, encapsulation) because they will be present throughout the course. Take your time and read the project descriptions, because honestly, reading and understanding it took more time than implementing it. Do not cheat!! This should be a default but many, many students get honor coded in this class. Do your own work!

I don't think I attended this class after the first two weeks of school. I had this class with the infamous Socrates. It was actually not as bad as the rumors said. Socrates, in my opinion, wrote the most clear project descriptions and gave the one difficult project (pixel manipulations) which bumped this class’s enjoyment rating from a 0/5 to 1/5. The other professors gave easy projects which mainly consisted of writing constructors, getter and setter methods, and very simple functions. I think the projects do give a good intro in object-oriented design, if you decide to put effort into it. I took this class with the honors college, which meant I had to do an additional project at the end of the course. I ended up doing Minesweeper using Java Swing and Java FX  Socrates ended up emailing the honors college kids after the course asking them to be TA’s. 

HNRS 110 : Research and Inquiry
Grade: A
Difficulty: 1/5
Enjoyment: 5/5 
Advice: If you think you are going to be interested in going into research/academia, this class is amazing for you. Put in effort, talk to the professor, and honestly you might be able to reach out to professors for research roles in their labs based on background work that you will have done in this class anyways. 

This was my favorite class this semester. I did have experience in technical writing for research papers from high school, so content-wise, it was not particularly new. I enjoy doing research and reading articles, so I was very comfortable in this class. The main highlights were frequent group discussions, something I miss from high school. Large lecture classes tend to drain energy, making it very difficult to focus and stay on task. I was able to find a few friends, making this class one of few classes I actually made friends in. I had this class with Dr. Winsler, who teaches psychology. The research topic I picked was “The Effect of Musical Training on Second Language Learning”, so we ended up having many conversations on psychology and behavioral experiments.  I was nominated for the first-year research award. 

HNRS 122: Metatheatrical Shakespeare
Grade: A
Difficulty: 1/5
Enjoyment: 3/5
Advice: If you’re in a boring honors class, put yourself out there and try to make it fun, especially if you can tell the teacher and the other students want it to be fun too. 

I like reading Shakespeare so I enjoyed the class somewhat moderately. We did a mini performance for class, which I was initially excited for, but it ended up turning into us reading in front of the class for 30 minutes with small gestures here and there. We read Midsummer Night’s Dream, Much Ado About Nothing, All’s Well That Ends Well, and Macbeth. It had the potential to be a lot more fun and engaging especially since the focus of the class was on the theatrical elements. Despite the professor’s abundant energy, the energy of the class was rather low.

STAT 344: 
Grade: A
Difficulty: 1/5
Enjoyment: 2/5 
Advice: Pay attention in this class, especially if you’re interested in AI/ML. Lots of very relevant topics. You can try building models or simulations to tie the concepts into your machine learning work to make it more engaging.

I did not attend this class after the first week as I didn't like the lecture style very much. I ended up reading from the textbook and learning the concepts on my own. There were 2 homework assignments which were very easy and the exams were all take-home, open-book, and very similar to the hw/textbook problems. Learned about binomial, hypergeometric, Poisson’s, normal, Gamma, Beta, and multinomial distributions. Lots of very fun concepts.
